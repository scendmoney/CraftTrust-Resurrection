# CraftTrust - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
CraftTrust is an enterprise-grade cannabis industry platform providing comprehensive supply chain management, compliance tracking, and marketplace functionality. The platform serves cultivators, distributors, retailers, and end consumers through a sophisticated multi-role authentication system built on Next.js frontend with NestJS backend.

## Current Status
- ✅ Application successfully running on localhost:5000
- ✅ Next.js 14.0.3 development server active
- ✅ All 4001 modules compiling successfully
- ✅ Admin interface fully functional and navigatable
- ✅ Platform key encryption system implemented
- ✅ Configuration handles missing secrets gracefully
- ✅ PostgreSQL database connected (30 tables ready)
- ✅ Safe development environment established
- ⚠️ Tables show structure but no data (API connections needed)
