```bash
npm install @splinetool/runtime@latest
```

### 2. Spline File Format Warning
**Severity:** Low  
**Category:** 3D Asset Validation  
**Details:**
- Warning: "The Spline Runtime only accepts .splinecode files that are generated from Spline export panel."
- Suggests some 3D assets may not be in the correct format
- Impact: Potential rendering issues with 3D components

### 3. WebGL Shader Warnings
**Severity:** Low  
**Category:** GPU Rendering  
**Details:**
- WebGL Program warnings detected in browser console
- "floating point division by zero" warning in shader
- "use of potentially uninitialized variable" warning
- Impact: Minor rendering artifacts possible, no functional impact

### 4. Browserslist Database Outdated
**Severity:** Low  
**Category:** Browser Compatibility  
**Details:**
- Warning: "caniuse-lite is outdated"
- Impact: Browser compatibility data may be stale
- **Fix:** Run `npx browserslist@latest --update-db`

## ‚úÖ Recently Resolved Issues

### GraphQL Module Resolution ‚úì

## üéØ Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Optional)
1. Update Spline runtime to latest version
2. Update browserslist database
3. Verify 3D asset export formats from Spline

### Long-term Maintenance
1. Regular dependency updates
2. Monitor WebGL performance on different devices
3. Validate 3D assets are using correct Spline export format

## üìä Impact Assessment

**Current Application State:** Fully Functional  
**User Experience Impact:** Minimal (cosmetic warnings only)  
**Business Logic Impact:** None  
**Security Impact:** None  

All core functionality is working correctly. The detected issues are primarily warnings related to 3D graphics libraries and do not affect the main cannabis industry features, user authentication, or business workflows.
